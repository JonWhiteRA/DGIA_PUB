I. Determination of Surplus, Obsolete, or Disposable Goods





A principal/program manager/designee will declare an item as surplus or excess.



A principal/program manager/designee will notify the Office of Purchasing or Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) Logistics Center of any surplus or excess property.




II. Reutilization of Surplus Goods





If a surplus item can be utilized elsewhere in the HCPSS, the Office of Purchasing will reassign as appropriate.



The Office of Purchasing will make available a list of excess property on the purchasing website or other electronic media.



When a school/department requisitions property, the HCPSS Logistics Center will check the surplus property list to determine if the request can be filled from that list.



If repairs or other services to goods and materials can be carried out in a cost-effective manner, they will be conducted under the direction of the appropriate administrator/supervisor knowledgeable and responsible for that item(s).



When a school/department receives surplus property, they will inventory and account for that property coming under their responsibility in the appropriate property database. Licenses and/or any fees associated with the property must accompany the surplus property being transferred.




III. Disposal of Surplus





If a surplus item is no longer useable, the Office of Purchasing will dispose of the item in one of the following ways:

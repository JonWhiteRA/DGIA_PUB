I. Referral, Evaluation, and Eligibility





A referral/request for services for a student will be delivered to the 504 Team.  Upon receiving a referral, the team will review information from a variety of sources and determine whether the student is eligible for a 504 Plan or whether additional information, such as assessments/testing, is necessary.



Parents will be provided notification of the time and place of all 504 Team meetings concerning their child. A copy of the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) Notice of Procedural Safeguards Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 will be provided to the parents prior to or at the 504 Team meeting.



If a 504 Team determines assessments/testing are necessary, parental consent will be obtained.



If parental consent is obtained, all assessments/testing should be completed within guidelines established by the HCPSS Procedures and Guidelines for Implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.



The HCPSS will provide any assessments/testing deemed appropriate by the 504 Team.



The HCPSS will consider any private evaluations submitted by the parents that are provided in whole to the 504 Team.



The benefits of mitigating measures, with the exception of ordinary eyeglasses and contact lenses, will not be considered when determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. If the 504 Team determines a student has a disability, then the studentâ€™s use of mitigating measures may be considered in determining whether or not the student requires a 504 Plan.



If a student meets eligibility requirements for a 504 Plan, the 504 Team will develop the 504 Plan. The accommodations and/or reasonable modifications of that 504 Plan should be designed to afford the student with a disability the opportunity to receive the benefits from programs and activities to the same extent as a l non-disabled student.

K-means is a popular clustering algorithm used in data analysis to partition a dataset into distinct groups (clusters) based on their features. It aims to minimize the variance within each cluster while maximizing the variance between clusters.

### Key Features:

1. **Centroid-Based**: K-means works by identifying "centroids" for each cluster, which are the mean points of the data points assigned to that cluster.
    
2. **Parameters**:
    
    - **K**: The number of clusters to form. This is a user-defined parameter that must be specified before running the algorithm.
    - **Max Iterations**: The maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run to refine the clusters.
3. **Algorithm Steps**:
    
    1. **Initialization**: Randomly select K initial centroids from the dataset.
    2. **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
    3. **Update Step**: Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.
    4. **Repeat**: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

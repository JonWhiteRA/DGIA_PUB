T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, typically two or three dimensions. Developed by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton, t-SNE is particularly effective for revealing structures in complex datasets, such as clusters and patterns.

### Key Features of t-SNE:

1. **Probabilistic Approach**: t-SNE converts high-dimensional Euclidean distances between points into conditional probabilities that represent similarities. It uses a Gaussian distribution to model these relationships in the high-dimensional space.
    
2. **Student's t-Distribution**: In the low-dimensional embedding, t-SNE uses a Student's t-distribution with one degree of freedom (which is equivalent to a Cauchy distribution) to compute similarities. This choice helps in better managing the "crowding problem," allowing it to capture more meaningful structures without crowding points too close together.
    
3. **Non-linear**: Unlike linear methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE captures complex non-linear relationships in the data, making it well-suited for visualizing intricate patterns.
    
4. **Parameter Sensitivity**: t-SNE has hyperparameters, such as perplexity, which can significantly affect the results. Perplexity can be thought of as a balance between local and global aspects of the data.
    
5. **Interpretability**: While t-SNE is great for visualization, the resulting lower-dimensional embeddings can be difficult to interpret quantitatively since the distances in the low-dimensional space do not directly correspond to distances in the high-dimensional space.
    

### Applications:

t-SNE is widely used in fields such as bioinformatics, image processing, and natural language processing to visualize complex datasets, explore clustering patterns, and gain insights into the underlying structure of the data.

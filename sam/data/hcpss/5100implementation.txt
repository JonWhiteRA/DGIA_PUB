VI. Supervision and Evaluation





Health Assistants




School nurses are responsible for supervising and evaluating health assistants in one or more schools.



The frequency and duration of supervision activities is dependent upon Maryland Board of Nursing Criteria for Delegation.



The process used by school nurses to monitor the performance of health assistants may include observation, review of records, and consultation with school administrators.



Criteria for evaluation will include and will comply with the evaluation tool designed for the purpose.



A formal evaluation will be conducted annually.



Principals/designees will provide written input to the annual evaluations using a form developed for that purpose. Principals will meet with health assistants to discuss their input and sign the forms.

VIII. Health Room Coverage





When a health assistant or school nurse is absent for a half day or more, every effort will be made to assign a substitute nurse or agency nurse to a health room. The school nurse will be notified and plans put into place to provide care for students with special health needs.



In the absence of a school nurse, arrangements will be made for temporary supervision of affected health assistants by a float nurse or another school nurse.



There may be times when health room coverage by health employees is not available. School nurses and principals are responsible for developing a plan for providing basic services in these situations.




IX. Communication





The Health Services Requirements and Procedures Manual will be available in each school in the health suite and on the school system website. This manual will provide specific information and direction for the provision of health care in the school setting. The manual will be revised and updated as necessary to be consistent with current standards of nursing and medical practice, and to reflect current state and federal requirements.



Basic information regarding health services, including screening requirements and medication administration, will be published in the HCPSS Student & Parent Handbook and on the school system website.

I. Policy Value Statement



The Board of Education of Howard County recognizes that the Howard County Public School System’s (HCPSS) policies and procedures identify many student rights and accompanying responsibilities. The Board believes students must be provided the opportunity to excel in a safe and supportive environment that inspires and engages every student to discover and reach their full potential.To support the rights and responsibilities of our students, all HCPSS schools must create and maintain positive and productive school environments grounded in dignity, self-worth, and belonging.Schools utilize a host of practices aimed at creating such environments which include but are not limited to Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), social emotional learning, restorative justice practices, and trauma informed care. The Board encourages the active pursuit of the values, opinions, beliefs and perspectives of individuals and groups of students to inform instructional approaches and enhance the school environment.
